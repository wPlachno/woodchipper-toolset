# The Woodchipper Python Library

This github repo contains several Python scripts written by Will Plachno. All you need is Python 3, and, if testing, PyTest.

## Included Modules

### article-examination
A script for analyzing a markdown library and finding which links are missing, and which files are unlinked.

### frontmatter-edits
ObsidianMD allows for YAML to be put in the beginning of the markdown file for keeping attributes. I use this alot. This script allows for bulk-operation YAML edits.

### git-ignore
A script for analyzing a .gitignore file, including adding, removing, clearing, and initializing. Also sets up the ignore list with the files created by Woodchipper Notes

### notes 
A script for viewing and saving notes that are attached to a local directory. 

### templates
A script for executing file templating.

### toolset
Originally used as infrastructure to keep a set of utility files updated between repositories. Now that I have put everything into one monorepo, this script is no longer supported.

### utilities
The Woodchipper platform.
